        Hello! My name is Ibrahim Rather and this is a website I built to
        showcase what I worked on and what I achieved while working as a
        Front-end developer for Health Canada in the Bureau of Microbial Hazards
        (BMH). Between January 2023 and April 2023, I had the opportunity to
        build a Labaratory Information Management System (LIMS) application.
        Below I will discuss more in detail the goals I achieved while working
        at Health Canada along with a more detailed explanation of what I
        learned.
      </p>
    </div>
